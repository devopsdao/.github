## devopsdao

Devopsdao app is built as a uniform platform to bring all software development processes to blockchain. It will be used as work marketplace for developers and art creators. Devopsdao user currently have two roles: customer and performer, and on a later stage an auditor role will be introduced to settle disputes. Customer is able to create Task contract with ETH and aUSDC tokens as a reward. Once Performers apply for a Task, Customer is able to select the Performer for Task implementation. After the Task is implemented the Performer applies for a Customer review. Currently all negotiations are performed off-chain via Customer selected method. When Customer is happy with the work done, he signs the review and the Performer will be able to withdraw the tokens to his preferred blockchain supported by Axelar (Moonbase, Ethereum, Binance, Fantom, Avalanche, Polygon).
